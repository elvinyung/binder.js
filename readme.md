# binder.js
### by [Elvin Yung](https://github.com/elvinyung)

### Introduction
Binder.js is a thin two-way databinding layer for clientside web applications.

### Examples
See examples [here](https://elvinyung.github.io/binder/).

### Other stuff
Although binder.js uses the term `model` quite heavily, I don't intend for this to become an MV(C|VM|P|.*) framework. The objective of binder.js is just to provide simple unbloated data-driven view abstraction.
